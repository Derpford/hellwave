# Map Notes

## MAP01: Temple of Belphegor
Might need fewer spoopy triangles. Post red-key ambush is a little bit of a grind.

## MAP02: Soulless Mall
Might want to knock down a wall on the right side of the Mall and disable the lifts so that we can have a Hookshot-like upgrade later (inb4 "you're stealing from Broken Reality")

Maybe a few more NPCs?

Need to come up with MAP04-MAP06.

## MAP03: BSP Forest
What cool things can I do with a forest?
- River running through an area, maybe an under-waterfall secret switch?
- Something hanging from the trees. Bodies for the spoop factor, or abstract dangly bits.
- Minisnek?
- Another ruined marble temple, this one possibly overgrown with vines. TODO: Make some transparent Sierpinski textures for this.
