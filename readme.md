"And what is your third wish?"

You stare, confused, at the old man in the wheelchair. "Third wish?" you ask.

"Ah. I know why you're confused. Your second wish was to return to how you were before. So, what will your third wish be?"

The answer is obvious. "I wish to become immortal."

"Funny," the old man says. "That was your first wish..."

## Running

Run with GZDoom. You shouldn't need any special settings, but you'll probably want to have your movement, use, and primary fire keys bound.

Your SOUL is split from your body, and appears as a glowing orb beside you. You yourself are immune to all attacks, but your SOUL is not. You may hold the walk/run key to make your SOUL stay put, but bear in mind that it may be ambushed. When following you, it'll try to navigate around obstacles.
